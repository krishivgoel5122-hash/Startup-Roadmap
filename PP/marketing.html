        Market research helps entrepreneurs understand whether enough people
        are willing and able to buy their product in a competitive environment.

    <h2 class="section-title">Why Market Research Matters</h2>
    <p>
      A strong idea in a weak market will still fail.
      Market research prevents entrepreneurs from building products
      that too few people want or are willing to pay for.
    </p>
    <p>
      Economically, this stage reduces uncertainty and prevents inefficient
      use of scarce resources such as capital and time.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section-block">
    <h2 class="section-title">Understanding the Economics</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Demand</strong> refers to how many consumers want a product
      and can afford it at a given price. If demand is low, even a well-built
      product may struggle to survive.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Supply</strong> represents existing alternatives in the market.
      High supply increases competition, often lowering prices and profit margins.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Market size</strong> determines revenue potential. A niche market
      can work, but only if pricing and costs align with limited demand.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="section-block">
  <h2 class="section-title">Real-Life Application</h2>

  <p>
    Imagine a student planning to start an online tutoring service.
    At first glance, demand may seem high because many students need help.
    However, market research may reveal that the space is already saturated
    with low-cost or free alternatives.
  </p>

  <p>
    From an economic perspective, high supply combined with moderate demand
    puts downward pressure on prices. This limits profit potential unless
    the entrepreneur offers clear differentiation.
  </p>

  <p>
    By researching competitors, pricing levels, and customer willingness to pay,
    the entrepreneur avoids entering a market where revenue would not justify
    the time and effort invested.

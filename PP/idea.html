      <h1>Idea Validation</h1>
      <p class="subtext">
        Idea validation is the process of determining whether a startup idea is worth pursuing
        before significant time, money, and effort are invested.

  <h2 class="section-title">Why Idea Validation Matters</h2>

  <p>
    Idea validation is the foundation of every successful startup.
    Without it, entrepreneurs risk investing time and money into
    solutions that customers do not actually need or value.
  </p>

  <p>
    From an economic perspective, poor idea validation leads to
    inefficient allocation of scarce resources.
    When founders pursue unvalidated ideas, they incur opportunity
    costs by giving up alternative ideas that may have been more viable.
  </p>

  <p>
    In real life, many startups fail not because the founders lacked skill,
    but because they skipped this stage and assumed demand existed.
    Idea validation reduces uncertainty early, when mistakes are cheapest
    to fix and learning is most valuable.
  </p>

  <!-- CONCEPT EXPLANATION -->
  <div class="section-block">
    <h2 class="section-title">Understanding the Economics Behind Idea Validation</h2>

    <p>
      Every entrepreneur operates under conditions of scarcity. Time, money, and energy are limited,
      meaning not every idea can be pursued. This is why idea validation is not just a creative step,
      but an economic decision.
    </p>

    <p>
      The most important concept at this stage is <strong>opportunity cost</strong>.
      When you choose to work on one idea, you automatically give up the chance to work on another.
      If the chosen idea fails, the loss is not only money, but also the opportunities that were sacrificed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Entrepreneurs also use <strong>cost–benefit analysis</strong> to evaluate whether the potential
      benefits of an idea outweigh the costs required to test it. If testing an idea requires
      high upfront investment with uncertain returns, the economic risk increases significantly.

  <!-- REAL WORLD APPLICATION -->

    <h2 class="section-title">Real-World Application</h2>

    <p>
      Consider a student planning to launch a custom hoodie brand.
      The idea may seem appealing creatively, but validation reveals deeper economic questions:
    
      Are customers willing to pay a price high enough to cover production costs?
      Are there existing competitors offering similar products at lower prices?
      Is the time spent designing hoodies worth more than pursuing another idea?
    

      By validating early—through surveys, pre-orders, or small test sales—the entrepreneur avoids
      large financial losses and learns whether the idea is economically viable.
